"""Builds docs/index.html: the whole record of Codebot in one file.

Every game of Luqman's keeps one HTML file holding the idea, the planning, every decision
and method, the session logs, and the screenshots with their explanations, rebuilt whenever
the game changes. So this is a generator rather than a hand-written page: the project notes
stay the source of truth, and the page is rebuilt from them.

Codebot is a Roblox game, so its screenshots cannot be taken by a script the way a browser
game's can. They are captured by hand in Studio and dropped into docs/shots/; a gallery
entry whose file is not there yet shows as a gap on the page, which doubles as the list of
pictures still to take.

    python3 tools/docs/build_docs.py
    python3 tools/docs/build_docs.py --publish                # and rebuild the local records site

The page is published as a website at SITE below. `docs-site publish` collects every
project's docs/index.html and deploys them together, so the link never changes and
anyone can open it.

Reads:
    ~/.claude/knowledge/projects/codebot/*.md and log/*.md   (override: KNOWLEDGE=...)
    the screenshots named in GALLERIES
    the header comments of the files named in CATALOGUES
    the test suites, which are run to count the checks
    git log

Writes docs/index.html, fully self-contained: every screenshot is embedded as a JPEG. No
Python packages beyond the standard library; `sips` (built into macOS) shrinks the images.

To add something: add its screenshots to a gallery in GALLERIES and run this again. Notes
written into the knowledge base appear on their own. Everything above the "engine" line is
this game's; everything below it is the same in every game's copy, except that this copy's
header_comment() also understands Luau's -- and --[[ ]] comments.
